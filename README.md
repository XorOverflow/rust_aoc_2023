# rust_aoc_2023

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, written in Rust.

First time doing AoC, and first time learning Rust (after a few weeks of basic docs and tutorials)
so the implementation is probably not the best.

For implementations requiring crates for specific libraries, the code is in a subdirectory with its
Cargo description. For most of the others where a simple "rustc day_x_y.rs" is enough, the rest is
directly in the root directory.
