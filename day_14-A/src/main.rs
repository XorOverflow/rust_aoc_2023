/*

A naive Algo to roll boulders until they block would
be easy to do with an exhaustive double iteration on each
column (find each blocking point then find each "O" to accumulate
on the point). It would probably be something like O(M*N)
with M,N the map dimensions, not too crazy. It would just be
a bit tedious to write.

Reading part 1, I guess that part 2 will ask
to do the same thing again in S/W/E directions, probably
repeatedly until a minimal total load is found.
Better to have a reasonably fast algo for part 1 from the start.
 */


/*
Instead of low-level iteration on each boulder, it is possible to
pre-process the map into a set of free ranges between square rocks:
For example for 1 line (on the E-W axis)
      ..##.....#...#
      ^^  ^---^ ^-^
=> [1-2]  [5-9] [11-13]

when computing the rolling, count the number of O inside each range
(ignore their position). After rolling, on the final map
each range will be replaced by their consecutive numbers of O at
the start or end (depending on the direction).

 An optimized version of this can be done with bit representation
(like in the day 13) and various bit-shifting operations instead of
settings a range of N elements in a bool slice[].
Actual puzzle input is of size 100x100 and rust supports u128 integer type,
so this will fit.

For expected Part2, after rolling, and when we will want to perform different rolling axis direction,
there will need to use 2 matrix representations of the map (transpose of each other)
for easier processing.
